# Metrics

### sta metrics:
![sta vs regular relay failures](../docs/sta_vs_regular_relay_jumper.png)


### to add:
* average returns for regular ppo jumper agents
* average returns for sta ppo jumper agents
* average returns for regular ppo heist agents
* average returns for sta ppo heist agents
* relay failure/generalization for regular ppo heist agents (redefined)
* same agent failure/generalization for regular ppo heist agents (redefined)


##### notes to self:
* could speed up relay/same agent failure evaluation by setting the environment to terminate after 500 steps
